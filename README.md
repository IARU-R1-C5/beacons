# IARU R1 VHF and UP coordinated beacons database

In this repository you will find a technical track of beacon database.

As of 2025 we are working on web based solution.

Currently you can find the "database" here in XLS format.

If you have any questions related to this database please contact: VHFbeacons@iaru-r1.org

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## How can I open the coordinated beacon database XLS file?

You need to right-click on beacons.xls and Save As on your computer.
Then you need to open this file with your local Excel.

## Where can I find the list of coordinated beacons?

Please go to https://github.com/IARU-R1-C5/beacons, you will be able to find a static database of coordinated beacons.

## Is there any map or searchable webpage where I can find the list of beacons?

Not yet, we are working on it.

## How can I coordinate my beacon?

Please send an email to: VHFbeacons@iaru-r1.org, with the following information:

1. Beacon Call (can be also planned)
2. Frequency of the beacon in kHz
3. Location (go to google maps, find beacon antenna location, right click and left click on its coordinates to copy them and paste to the email)
4. Height of the antenna above the ground level in meters (agl)
5. Height of the ground in the antenna installation place in meters (asl)
6. Antenna type(s)
7. Antenna radiation pattern (omni or directional)
8. Antenna radiation direction (if directional)
9. Antenna gain (for each antenna)
9. EIRP for each antenna in dBm
10. Current status (planned, on-the-air)
11. Contact email address of responsible person (by default coordination requester)
12. Contact callsign of responsible person (by default coordination requester)
13. Mode of transmission (CW, MGM, mixed, other), please specify details
14. Frequency stabilization source (OCXO, TCXO, GPS)

Based on this information Beacon Coordinator will check if your frequency is not colliding with othear beacons in their potential collision domain.

After agreeing the details you will receive a confirmation that beacon (based on provided data) is added to the coordinated beacon list.

Please also note that if the beacon that was coordinated will not be spotted on the dxcluster on the frequency that was coordinated for more than 3 years - we will remove it from coordinated beacon list.
